# To Do list with Vanilla-Redux

**[Start](https://hwahyeon.github.io/redux-js-todolist/)**

## Overview
This simple To-Do application is built using Vanilla Redux for state management. It allows users to add and delete to-do items.

## Implementation Details
- Redux Actions: Two actions (ADD_TODO and DELETE_TODO) are used to manage the state of to-do items.
- State Management: The state consists of an array of to-do items, each with a unique ID and text.
- Reducer: A reducer function handles the addition and deletion of to-do items based on the actions dispatched.

## Usage
- Adding a To-Do: Enter the text in the input field and submit the form.
- Deleting a To-Do: Click the "DEL" button next to the to-do item you wish to delete.
